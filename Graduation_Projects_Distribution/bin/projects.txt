23@Dr. Jaser Sa'ed@Protection coordination for highly photovoltaic-integrated power systems@In the recent years, with the concept of Smart Grids, there are a great interest in integration of photovoltaic (PV) units at distribution level. Along with a number of benefits, penetration of PV units in the distribution system imposes some serious challenges; protection requirements turns up as one of the most critical challenge in PV integration. In this project, the possibility of occurring mis-coordination between protection devices in distribution network will be addressed. On the other hand, there are several mitigation techniques used to solve the mis-coordination problem; a study of these technologies will be conducted and a suitable technique will be designed and implemented.

26@Dr. Ismail Khater@Arabic Sentiment Analysis@Sentiment analysis uses Arabic text analytics, which combines natural language processing with machine/deep learning approaches for building classification models and estimating sentiment scores. The project's aim is to build a model for sentiment analysis using an annotated list of positive and negative sentiment words in Arabic and a pre-trained word embedding. The project consists of two phases. Phase one might require building an Arabic dataset/corpus. Also, if we can find a publically available dataset, we will just use it. Phase 2 trains a machine learning classifier to estimate sentiment scores
27@Dr. Ismail Khater@Object Classification Using Deep Learning with Raspberry Pi@This project is aiming to deploy a deep learning algorithm (e.g., ResNet-50) onto a Raspberry Pi. We will build real-world computer vision applications (e.g., Object classification and recognition) and perform inference tasks on embedded hardware.
28@Mr. Aziz Qaroush@Content-Based Video Indexing and Retrieval: A summarization-based approach@Video summarization is the process of synthesizing an arbitrary video into an abstract, shorter, and understandable representation. Video summaries can generally be split into two main categories, namely dynamic and static summaries. Static summaries are formed from a set of images representing key events called keyframes, which also convey the video's temporal evolution. Static summaries are less entertaining than their dynamic counterparts as they are limited to still images. However, they introduce a more practical approach when extending video summarization to an applied video management and indexing solution. In this project, we will do video indexing based of the keyframes resulted form video summarization. Video indexing is the process of providing watchers a way to access and navigate contents easily; similar to book indexing. The selection of indexes derived from the content of the video to help organize v deo data and metadata that represents the original video stream. In this project, we will do video indexing based on the keyframes resulted from the video summarization stage.

One of these areas is a great trend towards using electronic delivery companies and electronic stores as well. So, our goal in this project is to develop an electronic platform and mobile application that combines electronic shopping and deal-hunting. It allows stores to provide their products. Also, its searches for the best matches of the user's needs. The application will be for household electrical appliances.
30@Dr. Hakam Shehadeh@Optimal Segmentation of BZU MICROGRID@A strategy to design microgrids with distributed generators consists of taking advantage of an existing distribution network (BZU microgrid) by sectoring the system into a set of microgrids with optimal autonomy. This project will deal with BZU microgrid and will look for a methodology for the optimal design of microgrids based on the virtual segmentation of a distribution system. it focuses on the optimal allocation and sizing of the distributed generation together with the determination of the virtual cut-set lines to form an optimized set of microgrids.
31@Dr. Hanna Bullata@Perception-to-action: Visually guiding a robot gripper to grab objects using openCV library under ROS operating system@Robotic arms (manipulators) end up with grippers, similar to human hands. These grippers are supposed to grab objects and move them around. Before grabbing these objects, they have to be well identified to make sure the gripper is grabbing the right object. The objects the gripper is supposed to handle are library books. Students are required to make use of a camera and a distance sensor in this project, among other sensors. The camera should be able to identify book boundaries on shelves using the openCV library. Then, using the distance sensor, the camera will be located appropriately in order to identify book titles. The images will be processed to extract text. Once the correct book title has been identified, the coordination perceptionaction must take place until the book is grabbed and put in a box. You need to build a simulated environment under ROS for a robotic 
32@Dr. Adnan Yahya@Quality and Recency Assessment of Web Content and Social Media Posts@General Area: Information Retrieval and Web Search. Arabic Natural Language Processing. Project Description: In the age of Big Data, digital content is growing fast without strict quality controls. It is natural for many to go first to the Web for their knowledge needs. The democratization of the Web when everybody can add own content without supervision, makes content quality a big issue. It is necessary to account for quality factors when returning documents in response to a user query. Current search engines try to do that but not adequately. One parameter of quality is recency: having the content adequately updated to reflect recent changes on the subject matter. This may be very important for news items, biographies, institutional and corporate sites and more. We would like to have assurances that the content is trustworthy and of good quality and is being current. The issue has been a topic of work in the scientific 
33@Dr. Adnan Yahya@Named Entity Disambiguation in Search Results in Arabic and English@General Area: Big Data, Information Retrieval, Web Search, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition. Short Project Summary: How to classify the search results returned by a search engine to disambiguate the main named entities in terms of parameters like topic, location and more. Project Description: In search results one could have information about multiple entities lumped together because these entities share the same name. As an Example you can have Jackson the Politician, the Artist and the Scientist/Physician. The search results on “Jackson” will lump all the pages relevant to any of these entities together while the user may be interested in one of them only. We would like to use the initial search results (full text or Abstract or “snippets” to help disambiguate the multiple entities lumped together by classifying them into several classes and asking the user if interested in a particular instance of the
