The use of multiple technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and smart devices can reduce the economic costs of the healthcare system. For this reason, we propose Doctor AI which will help patients with chronic diabetes manage their blood glucose levels in their target range, and also can assist in providing a healthier lifestyle for patients through activity and diet tracking. Doctor AI will propose a patient monitoring system based on Internet of Things (IoT) and a diagnostic prediction tool for diabetic patients. This system provides real-time blood glucose readings and information on blood glucose levels. It monitors blood glucose levels at regular intervals. Accordingly, it aims to prevent high blood sugar and significant glucose fluctuations and control on it. Doctor AI will provide a precise result where, the colle

23@Dr. Jaser Sa'ed@Protection coordination for highly photovoltaic-integrated power systems@In the recent years, with the concept of Smart Grids, there are a great interest in integration of photovoltaic (PV) units at distribution level. Along with a number of benefits, penetration of PV units in the distribution system imposes some serious challenges; protection requirements turns up as one of the most critical challenge in PV integration. In this project, the possibility of occurring mis-coordination between protection devices in distribution network will be addressed. On the other hand, there are several mitigation techniques used to solve the mis-coordination problem; a study of these technologies will be conducted and a suitable technique will be designed and implemented.

31@Dr. Hanna Bullata@Perception-to-action: Visually guiding a robot gripper to grab objects using openCV library under ROS operating system@Robotic arms (manipulators) end up with grippers, similar to human hands. These grippers are supposed to grab objects and move them around. Before grabbing these objects, they have to be well identified to make sure the gripper is grabbing the right object. The objects the gripper is supposed to handle are library books. Students are required to make use of a camera and a distance sensor in this project, among other sensors. The camera should be able to identify book boundaries on shelves using the openCV library. Then, using the distance sensor, the camera will be located appropriately in order to identify book titles. The images will be processed to extract text. Once the correct book title has been identified, the coordination perceptionaction must take place until the book is grabbed and put in a box. You need to build a simulated environment under ROS for a robotic

Static summaries are formed from a set of images representing key events called keyframes, which also convey the video's temporal evolution. Static summaries are less entertaining than their dynamic counterparts as they are limited to still images. However, they introduce a more
